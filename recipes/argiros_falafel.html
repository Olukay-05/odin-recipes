    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        This Middle Eastern food has a very long history. 
        The word falafel may descend from the Arabic word falāfil, a plural of the word filfil, 
        meaning “pepper.” Legume fritters, including versions made with fava beans and lentils, have existed in the Middle East for thousands of years.

        According to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Jewish-Food-Gil-Marks/dp/0470391308?tag=theshiintheki-20">The Encyclopedia of Jewish Food</a>, written by my friend Gil Marks: “The first known appearance of legume fritters (aka falafel) in the Middle East appears to be in Egypt, 
        where they were made from dried white fava beans (ful nabed) and called tamiya/ta-amia (from the Arabic for ‘nourishment’); these fritters were a light green color inside. 
        Many attribute tamiya to the Copts of Egypt, who practiced one of the earliest forms of Christianity. 
        They believed that the original state of humankind was vegetarian and, therefore, mandated numerous days of eating only vegan food, including tamiya.”

        Likewise, the Torah, the Song of Songs, the Mishnah, and the Talmud all mention deep fried lentil fritters, known as “ashishim.” 
        This means early forms of falafel were enjoyed in this region since biblical times, at least. 
        That’s some pretty ancient falafel!
