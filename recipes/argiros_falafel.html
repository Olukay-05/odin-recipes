    <h1>ARGIRO’S FALAFEL RECIPE</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        This Middle Eastern food has a very long history. 
        The word falafel may descend from the Arabic word falāfil, a plural of the word filfil, 
        meaning “pepper.” Legume fritters, including versions made with fava beans and lentils, have existed in the Middle East for thousands of years.

    <p>
        According to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Jewish-Food-Gil-Marks/dp/0470391308?tag=theshiintheki-20">The Encyclopedia of Jewish Food</a>, written by my friend Gil Marks: “The first known appearance of legume fritters (aka falafel) in the Middle East appears to be in Egypt, 
        where they were made from dried white fava beans (ful nabed) and called tamiya/ta-amia (from the Arabic for ‘nourishment’); these fritters were a light green color inside. 
        Many attribute tamiya to the Copts of Egypt, who practiced one of the earliest forms of Christianity. 
        They believed that the original state of humankind was vegetarian and, therefore, mandated numerous days of eating only vegan food, including tamiya.”

        Likewise, the Torah, the Song of Songs, the Mishnah, and the Talmud all mention deep fried lentil fritters, known as “ashishim.” 
        This means early forms of falafel were enjoyed in this region since biblical times, at least. 
        That’s some pretty ancient falafel!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>250g chickpeas soaked</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 bunch parsley</li>
            <li>1/2 bunch fresh coriander</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon hot paprika</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon balsamic vinegar with honey</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>pepper</li>
            <li>Olive oil for the pan</li>
            <li>3 1/2 tablespoon flour</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>A day ahead soak chickpeas in plenty of water until they swell. 
            Next drain and mash in blender.</li>
        <li>Put mash in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Puree the onion, garlic, parsley, coriander, baking soda, flour and spices for the seasoning.</li>
        <li>Then add the chickpeas; add the balsamic vinegar with honey and mix using a spoon. With the spoon, take a tablespoon of mixture. I like to make them Greek style, as large meatballs in a flat shape. Put in greased baking pan and brush them with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Bake in a well preheated oven 200ºC, for 15 minutes; turn over and continue baking for 10 minutes or until extra golden.</li>
        <li>Serve with Arabic bread, yogurt, lettuce and the fresh tomatoes.</li>
    </ol>
