    <p>
        This is the perfect recipe for your next brunch or special valentine breakfast. 
        It should take about 20 minutes with already peeled beans. 
        it’s amazingly simple to make and present beautifully.

        For the uninitiated, moimoi is a Nigerian breakfast staple made from pureed beans. 
        It’s perfectly savory and often served as accompaniment to breakfast porridge. 
        Traditional moimoi is wrapped in Banana leaves or Ewe Eran (Thaumatococcus daniellii).

        The inspiration for this came from Japanese rolled omelet. Ronke first experimented with the idea in late 2012 but it didn’t quiet work out. 
        I tried to prepare it on a stove top using the wrong pan type. If you want to achieve this roll stovetop, you need a large nonstick pan like the one she used for the Breakfast Yam Casserole. 
        It should be cooked on low heat in order to distribute the heat evenly.
