    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Simply bursting with flavor, this tomatoy, 
        super easy Mexican rice recipe is inspired by one of our favorite Mexican restaurant side dishes
    </p>

    <p>
        In other words, this Mexican brown rice recipe is our very favorite combination of things! 
        Each and every grain of brown rice is seasoned with juicy tomato sauce and spicy taco seasoning 
        (that trusty <a href="https://themodernproper.com/homemade-taco-seasoning">homemade taco seasoning</a> we’re always talking about, of course) 
        making for a big pot of goodness that’ll find all sorts of happy uses in your kitchen.
    </p>

    <p>
        Stuff burritos with it, serve it alongside some <a href="https://themodernproper.com/slow-cooker-crispy-carnitas">crispy carnitas</a>, or just eat it as-is—because we add black beans, 
        it’s basically a complete, one-pot vegan meal—for a quick, simple lunch. 
        If you really want to take things over the top, you could add some sliced avocado and garnish it with cilantro.
